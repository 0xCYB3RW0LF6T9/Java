Scanner class in Java supports nextInt(), nextLong(), nextDouble() etc. But there is no nextChar() (See this for examples) To read a char, we use next().charAt(0). next() function returns the next token/word in the input as a string and charAt(0) function returns the first character in that string, the number 0 in the function in CharAt(NUMBER)  represents the index of the single word of the string taken input, and set that index character to the char variable.
